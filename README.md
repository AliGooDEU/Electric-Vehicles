# Electric-Vehicles
## Project Overview
This is the first stage of an ongoing project into Electric Vehicles. This initial stage has involved exploratory data analysis and statistical modelling. Some of the analysis can be found on Tableau Public and other analysis is in the Python scripts here.

## Objectives
* This project intends to see if EVs are in the past or will still remain prevalent in our future. 
* To find out more about EV consumers by looking at the relationship between household income and base vehicle prices.
* To understand if range anxiety has been addressed by longer electric battery range and the proximity of EV owners to charging stations. 

## Key Questions

Have the number of EVs in Washington increased over time?
Have the makes of EVs changed over time?

Where are the EVs located? Are these places urban, suburban or rural?
What has changed over time?
Where do the cars that are not first registered in Washington come from?

What is the age range of the EVs?
Where are the oldest EVs located? Where are the newest?

Can we use this data or combine it with another data reference to infer the socioeconomic status of EV owners?
Is there a correlation between affluent areas and the number of EVs?
Why does King county have the most EVs?

Has the average MSRP changed over time? 
Have there been improvements to Electric Range over time?
Which Makes have the longest Electric Range? Which Makes have the lowest MSRP on average? Which have the highest?

Has the CAFV eligibility changed over time? Are newer models more likely to be eligible?
Are some electric providers in areas with more EVs than others?

## Data Overview
The data for this project was open source and used for the purposes of completing a CareerFoundry exercise. 
+ Primary data on Electric vehicles registered in Washington came from data.gov. Last updated on March 14, 2025. (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data) accessed on 18 March 2025.
The landing page has some explanations about the data.
